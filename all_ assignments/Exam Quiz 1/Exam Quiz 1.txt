Scenario 01: Employee Performance Evaluation

In a large corporation, the HR department needs to evaluate the performance of employees based on their sales records and customer satisfaction ratings. They want to identify the top-performing employees based on a weighted score that combines sales performance and customer satisfaction.

Hint: Use List comprehemsion & Lambda Functions

# Sample data: List of tuples containing employee names, sales figures, and customer satisfaction ratings

employees = [
    ("John", 50000, 4.5),
    ("Alice", 60000, 4.7),
    ("Bob", 45000, 4.2),
    ("Emma", 55000, 4.6),
    ("James", 48000, 4.4)
]

# Define weights for sales performance and customer satisfaction ratings
sales_weight = 0.6
satisfaction_weight = 0.4


Scenario 02: Calculating Square Roots of Even Numbers

Imagine you're tasked with calculating the square roots of even numbers from 1 to 10 using list comprehension and lambda functions.
